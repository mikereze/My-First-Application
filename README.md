My First Application is an android application with the name "Where should i go" .
this app lets us choose places then it shows us the available Restaurants in that specific place 
then we can see details about each of the Restuarants by clicking them.
just for the demo purpose the data and images are repetitive.
you can see that the button is directing to the right activity in the location and titles of the restaurants
this Application uses MVC pattern.
